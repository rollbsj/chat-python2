Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will dissolve parliament on Friday, paving the way for an election next month that she hopes will give her a stronger mandate to govern.

It was an "extremely weighty decision" that would "determine Japan's course together with the people", Takaichi told a news conference. She also told voters to entrust her with running Japan.

The vote to elect the 465 members of the House of Representatives, the lower and more powerful house in Japan, will take place on 8 February.

Takaichi and her cabinet have enjoyed high public support since taking office last October.
